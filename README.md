# automatic_contact
It is a android application that automatically updates the contact without any manual work.
Due to some or other reasons users are frequently changing the phone numbers. 
New number should be sent to everyone and ask them to update the contact details.
The reasons include departing to abroad, to avoid roaming charges while in other states and
if SIMs are not used for month long days they are deactivated by ISP. The phone number is made available to other users.
Nowadays phones are coming up with at least dual SIM. In all the above cases, sharing new contact number is not tedious job, 
but sharing new phone number to all the friends is tedious task. Here comes into picture our android application,
which solves the problem without the intervention of user.
